## Running an Ethereum Client

### Hardware Requirements for a Full Node


## The First Synchronizatin of Ethereum-Based Blockchains

### The JSON-RPC Interface
Ethereum clients offer an application programming interface and a set of Remote Procedure Call(RPC) commands, which are encoded as JavaScript Object Notation(JSON). 


## Remote Ethereum Clients
Remote clients offer a subset of the functionality of a full client. They do not store the full Ethereum blockchain, so they are faster to set up and require far less data storage. 

- Manage private keys and Ethereum addresses in a wallet.
- Create, sign, and broadcast txs.
- Interact with smart contracts, using the data payload
- Browse and interact with DApps.
- Offer links to external services such as block explorers
- Convert ether units and retrieve exchange rates from external sources.
- Inject a web3 instance into the web browser as a JavaScript object
- Use a web3 instance provided/injected into the browser by another client
- Access RPC services on a local or remote Ethereum node

### Mobile wallets
All mobile wallets are remote clients, because smartphones do not have adequate resources to run a full Ethereum client. 

### Browser Wallets
Metamask, ....
